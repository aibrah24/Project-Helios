Skin cancer is a problem with widespread impacts across the United States with approximately 9500 people diagnosed daily. More than 2 people die from this disease every hour, and the early detection of skin problems could be crucial in preventing the cancer from becoming fatal.

Skin cancer is one of the most serious conditions Dermatologists treat, and while most forms of skin cancer progress slowly, the sooner the treatment begins, the better the prognosis will be. 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer by the age of 70 and more than 2 people die of skin cancer in the U.S. every hour. Having 5 or more sunburns doubles your risk for melanoma. When detected early, the 5-year survival rate for melanoma is 99 percent. Skin cancer is detectable at an early-stage relative to other cancers. Our goal is to create a system to detect skin cancer at the earliest stage possible to reduce the risks and encourage early treatment using Image Processing and Machine Learning technology.

Skin problems are not easily detectable, even to the trained eye, and because these issues start out small, a person may not know about all the symptoms they are facing. Without regular screening appointments, problems may go undetected for months or even years. Our goal is to solve the problem of diagnosing skin diseases more effectively, in as early a stage as possible, where treatment is most effective, and lives can be saved. By training an AI to detect skin cancer through image processing, a user will not need to go through the long wait for a Dermatologist appointment and will be able to find out if a potential skin problem is either benign or malignant taking a picture and uploading it to our system. The machine learning model will then notify the individual of any potential problems and they can get early treatment that they may have missed out on otherwise.
